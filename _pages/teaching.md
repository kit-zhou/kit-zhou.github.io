* Dr Zhou is one of the best professors I have had at this university. Their course is extremely well organized and their method of teaching is very effective. Truly a 10/10 professor.

* Professor Zhou is amazing! She takes the time to really hear her students out and it always more than willing to work with anyone and help in any way she can. I would recommend to anyone!!!

* Great professor and very interesting to just listen to. Makes classes relatable to real world situations or to personal experiences. I find it interesting even thought I'm not that into the subject matter as I'm not a business major.

* The quality of of instruction was the best of my classes this semester! The lectures were engaging and understandable. She also made a point to connect with students on a personal level. You can tell she wants the best for her students whether for the course or in life.

* Probably the best instructor I have had at Southeastern thus far. If you go to class and complete your work you will do well. She is concerned with her students and how they are doing in her course and makes an effort to hear what her students think about the course.

* This has been one of my favorite classes at southeastern so far. Not only have I learned a lot but it was very clear what was expected of us

    * I appreciate how kind Kit Zhou was during this course. She always made accommodations for us since we are still in a pandemic so I really appreciate her consciousness throughout the course.

    * I thought the teaching in lecture was very helpful and bettered my understanding of the subject. I actually took away a lot from this course that I did not think I would take away as well.

    * Professor Zhou was a great teacher and cared deeply for students. I never felt like I was set up to fail. I was always given opportunities to ask questions and improve.

    * I always felt so much more confident about the material in the course after meeting with her. She was understanding and always kind. She responds immediately to emails and was always willing to help. She is very clear with communicating with the class and sends updates to make sure everyone is on track and aware of what is going on. In class, she always gave real-world examples that helped me understand the material better. She gave great examples of studies that were happening in the real world which made the material relevant. She made it clear she wanted us to succeed and be interested in the material. The exams reflected what we learned in class and did not try to confuse us. She made it clear she was open for office hours always and wanted to do everything she could to help us learn the material and do well in the class.
