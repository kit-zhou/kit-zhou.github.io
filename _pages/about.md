I am joining the College of the Holy Cross as an assistant professor in Fall 2025. Previously, I was an assistant professor at Southeastern Louisiana University. I earned my bachelor's degree at Vassar College (Economics and Mathematics, Class of 2015) and completed my PhD in Economics at Michigan State University in 2024. 

I'll be teaching ECON 110: Principles of Economics in Fall 2025 and ECON 255: Microeconomics in Spring 2026. 

My main body of research is the application of two-sided matching theory to the US foster care system and college admissions, among other matching markets. My research combines theoretical modeling with empirical analysis, and I am particularly interested in better understanding how to characterize opportunity, equity, and efficiency in these markets.

Planned upcoming conferences: SEA 2025
