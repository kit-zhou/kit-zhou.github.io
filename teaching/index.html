I actually took away a lot from this course that I did not think I would take away as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>Professor Zhou was a great teacher and cared deeply for students. I never felt like I was set up to fail. I was always given opportunities to ask questions and improve.</p> </li> <li> <p>I always felt so much more confident about the material in the course after meeting with her. She was understanding and always kind. She responds immediately to emails and was always willing to help. She is very clear with communicating with the class and sends updates to make sure everyone is on track and aware of what is going on. In class, she always gave real-world examples that helped me understand the material better. She gave great examples of studies that were happening in the real world which made the material relevant. She made it clear she wanted us to succeed and be interested in the material. The exams reflected what we learned in class and did not try to confuse us. She made it clear she was open for office hours always and wanted to do everything she could to help us learn the material and do well in the class.</p> </li> </ul> <p><br> <br></p> <h1 id="as-teaching-assistant-michigan-state-university">As Teaching Assistant (Michigan State University)</h1> <p><strong>Graduate level</strong></p> <p>EC 812b: Microeconomics II (Spring 2020, Spring 2021, Spring 2022, Spring 2023)</p> <ul> <li>Responsibilities included designing and teaching recitations.</li> </ul> <p><br></p> <p>Tutor: Microeconomics qualifying exam (Spring 2020, Spring 2021, Spring 2022)</p> <ul> <li>Hired by the MSU Dept. of Agriculture, Food, and Resource Economics (AFRE) to prepare AFRE and economics PhD students.</li> </ul> <p><br> <br></p> <p><strong>Undergraduate level</strong></p> <ul> <li>EC 201: Introduction to Microeconomics (Fall 2019)</li> <li>EC 241H: Microeconomics &amp; Public Policy, Honors (Fall 2020)</li> <li>EC 301: Intermediate Microeconomics (Fall 2018, Spring 2020)</li> <li>EC 302: Intermediate Macroeconomics (Spring 2019)</li> <li>EC 404: Behavioral Economics (Fall 2020)</li> <li>EC 480: Analysis of Labor Markets (Fall 2019, Fall 2022)</li> <li>EC 498: Economics of Health Care (Fall 2020)</li> </ul> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Kit Zhou.
